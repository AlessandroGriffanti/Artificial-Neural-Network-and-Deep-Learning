# Image segmentation of the Mars terrain
This project focuses on **image segmentation** using **deep learning** techniques. The main objective is to design a robust model that assigns a class label
to each pixel of 64x128 greyscale images concerning the Mars terrain.

Our approach, that is described in detail in the [report](https://github.com/AlessandroGriffanti/Artificial-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning/blob/6bf37ee243103b5c0f09ca5abd41196d161c5130/Segmentation%20Challenge/AN2DL_Homework_2_Report.pdf), utilizes a U-Net architecture enhanced with a custom loss function, data augmentation and attention mechanisms.
