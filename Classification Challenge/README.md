# Image classification of blood cells
This project focuses on **image classification** using **deep learning** techniques. The main objective is to design a robust model that classifies 96x96 RGB images of blood cells, like the followings:

  ![Blood Cells Images](https://github.com/AlessandroGriffanti/Artificial-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning/blob/a6935e182e841e3c5376339c6cfd26c883ed3e33/Classification%20Challenge/Images/blood.png)
  
into their respective categories, assigning the correct class label to each RGB image. 

Our approach to solve the challenge, that is described in detail in the [report](https://github.com/AlessandroGriffanti/Artificial-Neural-Network-and-Deep-Learning/blob/0b633f1b27b8b0d73f98e0cc36ce1e30deb02cc9/Classification%20Challenge/AN2DL_Homework_1_Report.pdf), utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) built upon a pre-trained architecture, enhanced by custom data augmentation techniques. This strategy leverages the strengths of transfer learning while addressing the unique characteristics of the dataset
